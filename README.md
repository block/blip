# Blip

![Build](https://github.com/cashapp/blip/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)

Blip is a MySQL monitor: it collects and reports metrics from MySQL to monitoring platforms like Datadog.
It works with all vendors and distributions of MySQL 5.7 and 8.0, on-premise and in the cloud.
It has built-in support for Datadog, Splunk, and Chronosphere, and a plugin architecture to report metrics to any monitoring platform.

Blip was created by engineers at [Cash App](https://cash.app) and [Square](https://square.com) and built for everyone using MySQL.
